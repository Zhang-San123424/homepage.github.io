## About Me

I am an Associate Professor and Master's Supervisor at the Xi’an Key Laboratory of Intelligent Perception and Autonomous Navigation for Low-Altitude Aircraft. I received my Ph.D. from the Air Force Engineering University and was a visiting scholar at Ryerson University, Canada (2022–2023).
My research focuses on visual perception for unmanned systems and intelligent interpretation of remote sensing images. I have led several national and provincial research projects and participated in multiple NSFC and defense-related projects.
I have been selected for the National Young Overseas Talent Program, recognized as a Shaanxi Province Youth Science and Technology Star, and as a Young Talent in Shaanxi Provincial Universities. I am also a Highly Cited Scholar by CNKI. I hold 5 invention patents and have received provincial awards for scientific and technological achievements.
I have published over 50 papers as first or corresponding author in leading journals, and serve as a youth editorial board member for several journals and regularly review for top journals in my field.

## Research Interests

- **Visual Perception for Unmanned Systems:** My work explores advanced computer vision techniques to enable unmanned systems to perceive, understand, and interact with complex environments autonomously.
- **Intelligent Interpretation for Remote Sensing Images:** I develop AI-driven methods to efficiently analyze and extract valuable information from multi-source remote sensing imagery for various applications.
